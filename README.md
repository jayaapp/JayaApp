_Learn Sanskrit by reading the Mahabharata in JayaApp!_

The main goal of the app is to support you in learning Sanskrit by gradually exploring the Mahabharata and interacting with each verse and each word through an extensive AI help system.

## Prerequisites

To use the AI assistant features (your Sanskrit teacher), you need a free <a href="https://ollama.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ollama Cloud account</a>. You will also need a free in-app registered <a href="https://trueheartapps.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">True❤️Apps</a> or a [GitHub](https://github.com) account to store the API key (see in-app setup instructions).

You can then use a number of predefined, learning-oriented help commands for whole verses or individual words, allowing you to gradually discover and internalize Sanskrit grammar and vocabulary as you read.

## Contributing

You are welcome to contribute to the app both as a user and as a developer. Simply learn the app by interacting with it or by reading the codebase.
