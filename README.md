This app is my offering to Mother Divine. Be it a tiny dot in Her eternal desire to love and awaken humanity.

The main goal of the app is to support You in learning Sanskrit by gradually reading and discovering the world of the Mahabharata while interacting with every verse and every word in it. To be able to use the AI assistant features that will serve as your Sanskrit teacher, you will need a free [Ollama Cloud account](https://ollama.com/). You can then use a number predefined learning oriented help commands on whole verses or individual words, allowing you to gradually and incrementally discover and internalize Sanskrit grammar and vocabulary as you continue reading.

The complete corpus translations provided within the app are AI-generated based on the original public domain Sanskrit text courtesy of [Sacred-Texts.com](https://www.sacred-texts.com/).
